# THUNDER
THUNDER is a machine learning pipeline for multi-label fraud detection in transactional data. It uses label-specific oversampling (SMOTENC) and threshold tuning to improve recall for rare frauds while maintaining precision, and supports easy feature expansion for time-dependent or rare fraud types.
